# Responsive Navigation Bar with React.js
This application was developed as a test assignment for Telia in order to proceed to the next round of the recruiting process. **Deployed version available [here](https://dizotoff.github.io/Reactjs-menu-assignment-/index.html)**
### Implementation 
Responsive horizontal navigation bar and React-driven drawer were built by combining functional and class-based React components. The app consists of 5 components and App.js which contains some methods which are passed as a reference to other components. Third-party frameworks weren't used during the development for the sake of a challenge. In the real world, it's probably more feasible to use something like [MATERIAL-UI](https://material-ui.com) for this kind of job to increase productivity. Responsive design was implemented for the good user experience on both mobile phones and TV screens. Also, every image provided with HTML <alt> attribute in order to satisfy the needs of screen reader users. Testing was done manually because of the small scope of the project.
